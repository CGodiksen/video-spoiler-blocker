# Video Spoiler Blocker
Browser add-on for blocking video length information from specific videos to avoid spoilers. Add-ons that block length information from all videos already exist but this add-on allows you to choose which specific videos to block, either by channel name or video title. When spoilers are blocked from a specific video, the video length is removed from the bottom right of the thumbnail and from the player. Filters can be added and removed using the popup. Channels can also be blocked by right-clicking the channel name and using the context menu.

## Usage
The intended use for the add-on is to block video length information from specific videos where this information would spoil the contents of the video. An example of this is blocking this information for Counter-Strike Global Offensive highlight videos. The following image shows a typical example of a CSGO highlight video on your Youtube front-page.

You know that this highlight video is for a best of 3 match and that a single game typically takes ~15 minutes when cut into only highlights. With this information you can now derive that the match was a 2-0 and even derive the winner after only watching the first game. Blocking the channel or blocking videos with titles including the term "HIGHLIGHTS | CSGO" would remove the video length information and result in the following image.
